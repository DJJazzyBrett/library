* TODO Summary

An algorithm is a precise and unambiguous recipe for solving a class of problems. If formulated as programs, they can be executed by a machine. Algorithms are at the heart of every nontrivial computer application. Therefore, every computer scientist and every professional programmer should know about the basic algorithmic toolbox: structures that allow efficient organization and retrieval of data, key algorithms for problems on graphs, and generic techniques for modeling, understanding, and solving algorithmic problems.
