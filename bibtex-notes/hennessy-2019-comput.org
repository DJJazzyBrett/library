** RISC-Based Machines

Advancements in technology / costs/ etc made it possible to develop successfully a new set of architectures with simpler instructions, called RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures in the early 1980s. The RISC-based machines focused the attention of designers on two (2) critical performance techniques:

  1. the exploitation of /instruction-level parallelism/ (initially through pipelining and later through multiple instruction issue)
  2. the use of caches (initially in simple forms and later using more sophisticated organizations and optimizations)

The RISC-based computers raised the preformance bar, forcing prior architecture to keep up or disappear.
